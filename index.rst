Welcome to Warming Up Design Toolkit documentation!
====================================================


This documentation describes how to use the WarmingUp Design Toolkit. The toolkit can be used to design future proof
district heating systems. The toolkit is developed in the collaborative
research program WarmingUp. More info can be found on  https://warmingup.info/designtoolkit/
The explanation on how to use the WarmingUp Design toolkit will be done via the different workflows,
which are available for the use to design district heating systems. The following
workflows are available:

*  Conceptual design of a district heating system
*  Pipe diameter optimisation
*  Topology optimisation
*  Buffer size optimisation
*  Temperature minimization

these work flows are further described in there respective sections
