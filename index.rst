Welcome to Warming Up Design Toolkit documentation!
====================================================


This documentation describes how to use the WarmingUp Design Toolkit. The toolkit can be used to design future proof
district heating systems. The toolkit is developed in the collaborative
research program WarmingUp. More info can be found on  https://warmingup.info/designtoolkit/
