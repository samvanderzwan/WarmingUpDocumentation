Topology optimisation
====================================================
Topology Optimizer is design optimization tool which enables the user to:

-. realize pre-set goals (e.g. minimizing cost),
-. by changing network design (e.g. pipe sizes or placement of storage assets), 
-. while complying with operational limits (e.g. available pump head). 

For grid simulation, Topology Optimizer makes use of the simulation environment 
(solver and simulation settings) of CHESS (Basic Control). 

Currently, there are two main applications of Topology Optimizer within the WarmingUP Design Toolkit; 
#. Determining optimal pipe sizes and routing for a fixed set of producer/consumer and storage assets, 
#. Determining an optimal set of producer/consumer and storage assets (along with the piping that connects them) in the setting of a grid expansion.
